# My 42 exam dotfiles

👋 Hello hello 👋

These are the dotfiles i have hardcoded into my brain for quickly setting up a
convenient dev-env when i write my exams @ 42. Apart from these files i
configure the `terminator` Terminal app to have no scrollbar and switching
between `panes` using `Alt-hjkl` or `Ctrl-Shift-hjkl`. Then i launch a single
terminal and create 4 splits aka 4 panes. In the upper left i have the examshell
running, in the lower left i can do system stuff (like adding cfg or something)
in the upper right i have the `subject.txt` open and in the lower right pane i
code using vim 8)

Something about my cfg: i use the xkb option `caps:swapescape` what this does it
swaps the caps-lock key with the escape key. In Vim you quite often have to
switch between normal and insert mode. So, in order to do this more efficiently
it is a good practice to move the ESC key closer to the home-row. Plus: who
needs Caps-Lock anyway, EXCEPT FOR SHOUTING? Which is not very polite :)
