# My 42 exam dotfiles

ðŸ‘‹ Hello ðŸ‘‹

These are the dotfiles i have hardcoded into my brain for quickly setting up a
convenient dev-env when i write my exams at 42. Apart from these files i
configure the `terminator` Terminal app to have no scrollbar and switching
between `panes` using `Alt-hjkl`. Then i launch a single terminal create 4
splits aka 4 panes. In the upper left i have the examshell running, in the lower
left i can do system stuff (like adding cfg or something) in the upper right i
have the `subject.txt` open and in the lower right pane i code using vim 8)

Something about my cfg: i use the xkb option `caps:swapescape` what this does it
swaps the caps-lock key with the escape key. In Vim you quite often have to
switch between normal and insert mode. So, in order to do this more efficiently
it is a good practice to move the ESC key closer to the home-row. Plus: who
needs Caps-Lock anyway, EXCEPT FOR SHOUTING? Which is not very polite :)
